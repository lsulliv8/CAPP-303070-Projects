<h2>Plans After Graduation</h2>
After graduation I plan to get a job at a technology firm, working in the finance department. I'm still undecided if I want to go back home and work in Boston or NYC, or whether I want to live with my sister in Chicago. With one more year of eligibility in lacrosse, I also have the option to stay at ND and get my MBA. 
I plan to make that decision at the end of this year but don't know if I really want to do another year in school. Hopefully after a couple of years of <strong>gruesome hours</strong> and <em>increasing salaries</em>, I will be able to move back to Boston with my boyfriend/fiance and start a family. I plan to spend the majority of my elder years, 30+, back home in Boston near my parents and my extended family. However, in order for any of this happen I have to get myself a starter job! Hopefully I will end this year with a good GPA and meet some people at the career fair tomorrow, finding a job that I would enjoy! </p>
